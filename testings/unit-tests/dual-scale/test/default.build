    <!-- This test project references the age-cohort library's test project
         (Landis.Test.AgeCohort.dll in references.txt) for the mock
         species-cohorts disturbance.  Unfortunately, when the age-cohort
         library is built for the first time for a new release of the
         LANDIS-II core, the library and its test project are in
         My Documents/software/release because the core release is not yet
         installed into C:\Programs\Landis-II.  When this test project is
         built, the core release is installed, so the FLEL build system
         looks in the core release's bin folder for the age-cohorts' test
         project.  As a workaround, we copy the age-cohorts' test project
         if it doesn't exist in the install directory for the release
         configuration.
